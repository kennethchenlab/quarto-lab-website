The Chen Lab studies how disruptions in gene expression drive childhood cancers.

Gene expression is tightly controlled in healthy cells, but in many pediatric tumors these regulatory systems break down, leading to abnormal cell identity and unchecked growth.

Our work focuses on understanding how defects in RNA regulation reshape gene expression programs in cancer. Because pediatric cancers can exploit pathways from normal embryonic development, we use the tools of developmental biology to understand how pediatric cancers form. Ultimately, we aim to uncover new biological vulnerabilities and more effective, less toxic therapies for children with cancer.
