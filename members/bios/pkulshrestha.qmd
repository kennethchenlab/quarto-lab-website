## Research Background

My journey in research began during my master’s degree dissertation, where I studied diseases mechanism of hypoglycemia and its treatment strategy. Driven by a passion for research, I joined the [L.V. Prasad Eye Institute](https://www.lvpei.org/), India, for my PhD. There, I focused on investigating the role of microRNAs, tiny RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, in uveitis, an inflammatory eye disease.

For my postdoctoral training, I joined Dr. Chen's laboratory to investigate the gene expression driven by *DROSHA* mutations, which results in Wilms tumor in pediatric population. I am deeply motivated to work on diseases of global health significance and aim to contribute findings that can benefit childhood cancer patients worldwide.

## When I'm not in the lab

In my free time, I love spending quality moments with my daughter, whose laughter and curiosity fill my days with immense joy. I enjoy exploring new destinations, immersing myself in different cultures, and creating cherished memories with family and friends. Listening to music or engaging podcasts is another pastime. Additionally, I find great satisfaction in experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, where I can express creativity and share delicious meals with my loved ones.
