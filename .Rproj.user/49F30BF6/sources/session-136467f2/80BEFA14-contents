Gene expression is a highly dynamic process. To regulate RNA synthesis and degradation,
cells use a variety of tools for regulating gene expression.

However, **many childhood cancers are driven by loss of these regulatory tools**.
For example, loss of one of these tools, known as *microRNAs*, can lead to a variety
of rare childhood tumors. Many other cancers bear mutations in transcription factors,
the proteins that give a cell its identity by determining which genes are expressed.
Yet other cancers are driven by mutations in chromatin remodeling complexes.

**We study how dysregulation of RNA synthesis and degradation drives childhood cancers**
with the ultimate goal of identifying new therapeutic vulnerabilities to exploit
in treating them.

## DICER1-related cancers

One particular gene which regulates gene expression, known as *DICER1*, is mutated in
a wide range of rare cancers. *DICER1* is one of the key enzymes in microRNA production.
In fact, some people are born with germline variants in *DICER1* that predispose them to
developing cancer.

However, no therapies have been developed for *DICER1*-related cancers. We seek to
understand how these cancers arise using both *in vitro* and *in vivo* models.

## Wilms tumor

Wilms tumor is the most common pediatric kidney cancer. Many cases are driven by mutations
in transcription factors, chromatin remodeling factors, or microRNA processing genes.
We are studying how these mutations affect gene expression and drive tumor formation.

These studies are performed both *in vitro* using cell-line models and *in vivo* by
generating genetically engineered mouse models. In addition, we continue to sequence
Wilms tumors to fully describe the landscape of gene dysregulation mechanisms.

## Chemoresistance

Dactinomycin, an inhibitor of transcription (RNA production), is one of the most commonly
used chemotherapy drugs for childhood cancers including Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma,
and pleuropulmonary blastoma.

However, most tumors that are resistant to front-line therapy become impossible to treat.
We are investigating how tumors evade transcriptional inhibition and ways to target
these escape mechanisms.
