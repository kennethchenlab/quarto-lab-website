## Research Background

I first caught the research bug in 2010 when I joined the
[Protein Structure and Immunology Laboratory](http://nimbb.upd.edu.ph/?page_id=192)
at the [University of the Philippines Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/).
I joined the effort in defining the altering landscape of integrins during cancer
progression as my undergraduate thesis.

After spending a year working with the Dengue Research Group at
[St Luke’s Medical Center](https://www.stlukes.com.ph/) in Quezon City, Philippines,
I moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. At the
[University of Utah](https://uofuhealth.utah.edu/huntsman/),
my dissertation focused on the impact of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations on gliomas.

In 2019, I was welcomed as the Chen Lab’s first postdoctoral research fellow.
My primary focus has been on actinomycin resistance in Wilms tumors.
I am also deeply involved in expanding *in vivo* and *in vitro* models of this cancer.

At the end of the day, my goal is to translate our findings from
bench to bedside and improve current treatment protocols for patients.

## When I’m Not in the Lab

Born and raised in the Philippines, I am an island girl at heart.
After adjusting to a landlocked lifestyle, I’ve learned to love hiking and alpine skiing.
I enjoy walking my (rotund) dog, swimming, playing the piano or ukulele, drawing caricatures,
writing, listening to podcasts, (extreme) karaoke, and experimenting in the kitchen.
