## Research Background

I joined Dr. Chen's lab early 2022 as lab manager. Our lab is focusing on pediatric kidney cancer, which brought me back to microscopy to see beautiful images of developmental stages of kidney tumors in mice. Previously, I worked in the Departments of Pharmacology (with insect cells and parasites) and Neurology (on COVID-19), and every job has expanded my knowledge and enriched me.

## When I'm not in the lab

Science is also involved in my hobbies. I love gardening and call myself beekeeper.
