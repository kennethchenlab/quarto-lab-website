## Research Background

I was born and raised in Grapevine, Texas, but left the DFW area for something slightly different and more humid for college at the University of Houston. There, I did undergraduate research in the lab of Dr. Benjamin Deneen at Baylor College of Medicine, where I worked on a project that helped uncover the different epigenetic roles that the transcription factor *Sox9* plays in different subtypes of brain cancer.

Missing Dallas, I moved back and joined Dr. Sean Morrison’s lab at UT Southwestern as a research technician, where I worked on many projects that helped further define the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.

In 2024, I joined the Basic Biomedical Sciences PhD program at UT Southwestern, and in 2025 I joined the Chen Lab. I am interested in pediatric cancer, its genetic drivers, and uncovering ways to exploit these mutations for therapeutic benefit. My work focuses on how specific point mutations in the *DICER1* gene lead to defective microRNA expression and tumorigenesis.

## When I’m Not in the Lab

I have a roommate named Cactus (pictured above) who enjoys my company (despite not looking like he does). When I’m not in the lab, I like to read, cook, play the Wii (yes, the one from 2006), and
