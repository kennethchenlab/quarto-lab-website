Driven by a passion for research, I joined the L.V. Prasad Eye Institute, India, for my PhD. There, I focused on investigating the role of microRNAs, tiny RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, in uveitis, an inflammatory eye disease.\nFor my postdoctoral training, I joined Dr. Chen’s laboratory to investigate the gene expression driven by DROSHA mutations, which results in Wilms tumor in pediatric population. I am deeply motivated to work on diseases of global health significance and aim to contribute findings that can benefit childhood cancer patients worldwide."
