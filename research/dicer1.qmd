## Overview

Mutations in the microRNA-processing gene *DICER1* predispose individuals to a
spectrum of rare pediatric cancers.

## Our approach

We use a combination of genomic analysis, cell-based models, and in vivo systems
to understand how DICER1 dysfunction alters gene expression and drives tumorigenesis.

## Current directions

- Mechanisms of microRNA loss
- Tumor-specific vulnerabilities
- Translational opportunities
