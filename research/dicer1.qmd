Mutations in the microRNA-processing gene *DICER1* predispose individuals to a
spectrum of rare pediatric cancers.

We use a combination of genomic analysis, cell-based models, and in vivo systems
to understand how *DICER1* dysfunction alters gene expression and drives tumorigenesis, in terms of:

- Mechanisms of microRNA loss
- Tumor-specific vulnerabilities
- Translational opportunities
